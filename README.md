## Build Setup

You need to have node v 10.23.0 installed. Better use nvm to manage node versions.

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm run install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
